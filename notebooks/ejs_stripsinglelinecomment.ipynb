    "<%# # Functional Specification Document for EJS Template %>\n",
    "<%#  %>\n",
    "<%# ## 1. Purpose %>\n",
    "<%# The purpose of the EJS template is to render an interactive web page within an ExpressJS application that allows users to view and manage Program Letters and their associated Line Items. The page provides navigation tabs to switch between different views (Program Letter, Line Item, Secondary Letter, Secondary Line Item) and offers functionality to create new Program Pricing Requests if the user has the appropriate permissions. %>\n",
    "<%#  %>\n",
    "<%# ## 2. Function Inputs %>\n",
    "<%# The expected inputs for this page include: %>\n",
    "<%#  %>\n",
    "<%# - `requestor` (Boolean): A flag indicating whether the current user can request new program pricing. %>\n",
    "<%# - `fullAccess` (Boolean): A flag indicating whether the current user has full access to create new entries. %>\n",
    "<%# - `gtagId` (String): A unique identifier used for Google Analytics tracking. %>\n",
    "<%#  %>\n",
    "<%# These inputs are provided as attributes from the request object passed into the EJS template by the server-side rendering process. %>\n",
    "<%#  %>\n",
    "<%# ## 3. Process Flow %>\n",
    "<%# 1. The server-side ExpressJS application renders the EJS template with provided input data (`requestor`, `fullAccess`, `gtagId`). %>\n",
    "<%# 2. The template checks if either `requestor` or `fullAccess` is true. %>\n",
    "<%#    - If true, it displays a button allowing users to create a new Program Pricing Request. %>\n",
    "<%# 3. The template includes navigation tabs that allow users to switch between different sections: Program Letter Search, Line Item Search, Secondary Letter Search, and Secondary Item Search. %>\n",
    "<%# 4. When a tab is clicked: %>\n",
    "<%#    - JavaScript attached to each tab's click event will handle showing and hiding relevant sections of the page dynamically without reloading. %>\n",
    "<%# 5. The 'section' div serves as a placeholder where content related to each tab will be dynamically inserted via client-side JavaScript. %>\n",
    "<%# 6. The 'table-section' div is another placeholder intended for dynamic insertion of DataTables generated by client-side scripts. %>\n",
    "<%#  %>\n",
    "<%# ## 4. User Flows %>\n",
    "<%# ### General User Flow: %>\n",
    "<%# 1. **Entry Point**: User navigates to the Program Letters page via URL or menu selection. %>\n",
    "<%# 2. **Decision Point**: If user has `requestor` or `fullAccess`, they see a button to create a new Program Pricing Request. %>\n",
    "<%#    - If clicked, they are taken to a form for creating a new request (`/programLetters/new`). %>\n",
    "<%# 3. **Navigation**: User clicks on one of four tabs (Program Letter, Line Item, Secondary Letter, Secondary Line Item) based on their interest. %>\n",
    "<%# 4. **Content Interaction**: Depending on selected tab: %>\n",
    "<%#    - Relevant search section appears where further actions can be taken (e.g., searching/filtering data). %>\n",
    "<%# 5. **End Points**: %>\n",
    "<%#    - User may leave by navigating away from the page or closing their browser/tab. %>\n",
    "<%#  %>\n",
    "<%# ### Admin/User with Full Access Flow: %>\n",
    "<%# 1. Same as General User Flow but includes additional step after Entry Point: %>\n",
    "<%# 2. **Create New Request**: Clicks \"New Program Pricing Request\" button and fills out form on `/programLetters/new`. %>\n",
    "<%#  %>\n",
    "<%# ## 5. Outputs or Rendered Elements %>\n",
    "<%# - A \"New Program Pricing Request\" button is rendered if user has permissions (`<a>` element with class `.btn .btn-outline-dark`). %>\n",
    "<%# - Four navigation tabs are rendered (`<button>` elements with class `.nav-link`) corresponding to different search sections. %>\n",
    "<%# - Two placeholders (`<div>` elements with classes `.section` and `.table-section`) are present for dynamic content insertion based on active tab selection. %>\n",
    "<%#  %>\n",
    "<%# ### Tables Rendered %>\n",
    "<%# Each table's headers and mapped data attributes will be defined in separate JavaScript files referenced at the bottom of this EJS template (`/scripts/programLetters/tabledefs.js`). These scripts will use AJAX calls to fetch data from the server and populate tables accordingly using DataTables plugin configurations. %>\n",
    "<%#  %>\n",
    "<%# ### Forms Submitted %>\n",
    "<%# No forms are submitted directly through this EJS template; however, clicking \"New Program Pricing Request\" redirects users to another route that likely contains a form submission process. %>\n",
    "<%#  %>\n",
    "<%# ## 6. Error Handling %>\n",
    "<%# This EJS template does not include explicit error handling mechanisms within its code structure; it assumes that any errors related to permissions or data fetching will be handled by other parts of the application workflow such as middleware or API endpoints. %>\n",
    "<%#  %>\n",
    "<%# ## 7. Dependencies %>\n",
    "<%# External dependencies include: %>\n",
    "<%#  %>\n",
    "<%# - Partials: Head (`../partials/head`) and Navbar (`../partials/navbar`) which contain HTML head elements and navigation bar respectively. %>\n",
    "<%# - Vendor Libraries: Included at bottom within partial (`../partials/vendor-libs`) which likely contains references to jQuery, Bootstrap JS, DataTables plugin JS/CSS files etc. %>\n",
    "<%# - JavaScript Files: Two scripts specific for program letters functionality (`/scripts/programLetters/tabledefs.js`, `/scripts/programLetters/all.js`) which handle table definitions and all other client-side logic respectively. %>\n",
    "<%#  %>\n",
    "<%# ## 8. Assumptions & Constraints %>\n",
    "<%# Assumptions: %>\n",
    "<%# - It is assumed that all necessary CSS stylesheets and JS libraries are correctly linked in included partials for proper display and functionality of components like buttons and tabs. %>\n",
    "<%# - It is assumed that user permissions flags (`requestor`, `fullAccess`) are accurately set before rendering the page. %>\n",
    "<%#  %>\n",
    "<%# Constraints: %>\n",
    "<%# - The functionality of this page is constrained by the user's permissions; without `requestor` or `fullAccess`, the ability to create new Program Pricing Requests is not available. %>\n",
    "<%# - The dynamic content loading and table rendering are dependent on client-side JavaScript; users with JavaScript disabled will not experience full functionality. %>\n",
    "<%# - The template operates effectively only in an environment where all dependencies (partials, vendor libraries, and scripts) are available and correctly configured. %>\n",
