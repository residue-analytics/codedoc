    "1. **Purpose**:\n",

The form captures essential information about the quote, such as customer details, sales engineer, CSR (Customer Service Representative), dates, contact information, financial details, and additional notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Page Inputs**:\n",
    "   - `quote`: An object containing pre-populated quote data such as customer account information, OEM details, and other quote-related attributes.\n",
    "   - `quoteRecordId`: A string representing the record type ID for the quote.\n",
    "   - `contactId`: A string representing the ID of the contact creating the quote.\n",
    "   - `contacts`: An array of objects, each containing an `Id` and `Name__c`, representing potential sales engineers or CSRs.\n",
    "   - `map`: A Map object containing selection options for language and currency fields.\n",
    "   - `rogersCCset`: A Set object containing IDs of selected RogersCC contacts.\n",
    "   - `gtagId`: A string representing a Google Tag Manager ID.\n",
    "   - `moment`: A library for date manipulation.\n",
    "   - `itar`: A boolean indicating if ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) restrictions apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Process Flow**:\n",
    "   - The form is pre-populated with data from the `quote` object where applicable.\n",
    "   - The user selects or inputs data into form fields. Some fields are read-only, while others are required (marked with a red asterisk).\n",
    "   - Date fields are validated against current dates using the `moment` library to ensure they are within acceptable ranges.\n",
    "   - Upon submission, the form data is sent to the server via a POST request to the `/quote/newPrg` endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **User Flows**:\n",
    "   - Entry Point: User navigates to the new PRG quote creation page.\n",
    "   - Decision Points:\n",
    "     - User can fill out the form with necessary details.\n",
    "     - User can select sales engineer and CSR from dropdowns.\n",
    "     - User can choose language and currency from dropdowns.\n",
    "     - User can input financial details such as duty, handling rate, currency rate, and VAT.\n",
    "     - User can check the ITAR compliance checkbox if applicable.\n",
    "     - User can add comments and internal notes.\n",
    "     - User can select multiple RogersCC contacts from a multi-select dropdown.\n",
    "   - End Points:\n",
    "     - User submits the form to create a new quote and proceed to add items to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Outputs or Rendered Elements**:\n",
    "   - Text inputs: Customer name, RFQ Receipt Date, Quote Effective Date, Contact Name, Contact Email, Agent Name, OEM Name, Program Name.\n",
    "   - Dropdowns: Sales Engineer, CSR, Language, Currency, RogersCC (multi-select).\n",
    "   - Date inputs: RFQ Receipt/Revision Request Date, Quote Effective Date, Quote Expiration Date.\n",
    "   - Checkboxes: ITAR compliance checkbox.\n",
    "   - Textareas: Comments and Notes fields for additional information.\n",
    "   - Buttons: A submit button to save the quote and proceed to add items.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Types of Actions**:\n",
    "   - Form Submission: The primary action is submitting the form to create a new quote with the provided details.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - Client-side validation ensures required fields are filled out before submission.\n",
    "   - Server-side error handling should manage cases where the form submission fails due to invalid data or server issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Dependencies**:\n",
    "   - Partials: `head`, `navbar`, `vendor-libs`, `foot`.\n",
    "   - JavaScript: `newQuote.js` script for client-side logic.\n",
    "   - Libraries: `moment` for date manipulation and timezone handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Assumptions & Constraints**:\n",
    "   - It is assumed that the user has the necessary permissions to create a new quote.\n",
    "   - The server endpoint `/quote/newPrg` is expected to handle the form submission correctly.\n",
    "   - The page relies on accurate data being passed into the EJS template for pre-population of fields.\n",
    "   - The moment library is assumed to be configured correctly for timezone handling.\n",
